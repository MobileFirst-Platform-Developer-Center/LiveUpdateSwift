## Hello Live Update

In the sample application you select a country and using Live Update the app then outputs text in language that corresponds to the selected country.

### Usage

1. Download and deploy the Live Update adapter [as instructed in the tutorial](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/using-the-mfpf-sdk/live-update/#adding-live-update-to-mobilefirst-server).
2. Add a scope mapping for **configuration-user-login** in **MobileFirst Operations Console → [your application] → Security tab → Scope-Elements Mapping**.
3. [Import the Live Update schema and segments](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/using-the-mfpf-sdk/live-update/#import-export) for the sample application:
 * [schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/LiveUpdateSwift/release80/schema.txt)
 * [segments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/LiveUpdateSwift/release80/segments.txt)  
4. From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the command `mfpdev app register` to register the application.
5. In Xcode, run the app in the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

> **Tip:** you can update the bundled SDK by running the command `pod update` from the project's root folder.

#### Changing Live Update Settings
Each segment gets the default value from the schema. Change each one according to the language. For example, for French add: **helloText** - **Bonjour le monde**.

In **MobileFirst Operations Console → [your application] → Live Update Settings → Segments tab**, click on the **Properties** link that belongs, for example, to **FR**.
  
* Click the **Edit** icon and provide a link to an image that representes for example the France geography map.
* To see the map while using the app, you need to enable to `includeMap` feature.

#### Note
To be able to immediatly experience changes, go to the **Live Update Settings** configuration tab and set the `expirationPeriod` to a smaller value (e.g: 5 seconds).
